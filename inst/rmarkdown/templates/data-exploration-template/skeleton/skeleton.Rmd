# Chapter XXXX 

### 1 - What's it all about?!

Type your response to the question here...in this space...right where these words are... just like you would in a word document or any other word processing program.

```{r include=FALSE}
# Use this first chunk to "set" your API key.
# Use fredr_set_key and put your API key into the parentheses and in quotation marks as shown. 

fredr_set_key("27bd08c56e8be777ea9705d29146d1b3")

# make sure you run this chunk, otherwise you will not be able to use fredr.
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# This chunk searches FRED for the ID of the series you might want according to a keyword you enter.
# For example, if you put "population" in the parameter above (on line 14), and then run this chunk, you will observe all of the data series that match.
# You can change the keyword by changing it above in the parameter section.

fredr_series_search_text(params$series_search_text)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# So you found a relevant series ID. Now we want to gather the data for that series. 
# Let's stick with population and use "POP". 
# Run the following code to collect the data from FRED and assign it to a name related to that data. For example, I am going to assign "pop" the fredr code that collects the data on population and places it in a data frame.
# The leftward arrow is the assignment operator.

# here is the code to gather data on population (measured in thousands) in the United States

pop <- 
  fredr(series_id = "POP") %>% 
  data.frame()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Now we can start graphing the data
# With most of the data from fredr, we will stick with an x-value of "date" and a y-value of "value"

pop %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) +
  # add_rec_shade(min(real_gdp_new$date), max(real_gdp_new$date)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Population, 1952-2020") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman"))
```

### 2 - Let's say you are asked to find the percent change from a year ago

You still type your answers to the question here. or here and here. or even in this space too!

```{r include=FALSE}
# Sticking with population and pop, let's say we want to see the percent change from a year ago of the population. 
# First, recall the percent chnge formula, i.e., (new - old)/old.
# The following code transforms the data you want into percent change from a year ago (assuming the data is monthly)
# Note that this assumes the data is monthly like the data for population. This is why the "slideBy" code is 12.
# A series that is quarterly would slide back by 4 units.

pop_new <-
  pop %>% 
  DataCombine::slide("value", 
                     NewVar = "pop_lag", 
                     slideBy = -12) %>% 
  mutate(pop_percent_change = (value-pop_lag)/pop_lag)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# More on the code from the previous chunk:

# This code actually creates two "new" variables. The first, "pop_lag", is the population data lagged by some period of time---in this case it is one year (or 12 months).

# The second, "pop_percent_change" is the population measured as a percent change from a year ago.

# You could also create your own *function* for the yearly percent change---to simplify the process going forward---but I will leave this to you to figure out. For now, you can always copy and paste this code.
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# So here is the graph on population measured in terms of percent change from a year ago. 

pop_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = pop_percent_change)) +
  # add_rec_shade(min(real_gdp_new$date), max(real_gdp_new$date)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Population Growth, 1952-2020", y = "Percent change from a year ago") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 100,
                                                      suffix = "%")) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman"))
```

### 3 - So you want to put two data series on the same graph

What an interesting answer you have right here...

```{r echo=FALSE}
# We often want to observe and analyze multiple data series in relation to one another. 
# We need to put them on the same graph. 
# To do this combine the series into a single data frame.
# For example, let's look at the M1 and M2 money stock.

# We gather each data series from FRED

M1_monthly <- 
  fredr(series_id = "M1SL") %>% 
  data.frame()
M2_monthly <- 
  fredr(series_id = "M2SL") %>% 
  data.frame()

# Combine by using inner_join and pivot_longer
combine_money_stock <- 
  M1_monthly %>% 
  inner_join(M2_monthly, by = "date") %>% 
  # Most of the series we gather from fredr will have a date variable.
  # Remember to make sure the dates are consistent with each other, e.g., each series you combine should have the same units of measurement.
  rename(m1 = value.x,
         m2 = value.y) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("m1", "m2"),
               names_to = "money_stock",
               values_to = "dollars")

# Graph

combine_money_stock %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = dollars, color = factor(money_stock))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "M1 and M2 Money Stock, 1960-2020", y = "Billions of Dollars") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman"), 
        legend.title = element_blank())

# You can combine as many data series as you want, but follow the format shown above.
```

### 4 - Sometimes you might want to include recession shading

What a lovely recession you have there.

```{r include=FALSE}
# This entire chunk is code used to create a function that you can add to a graph so it highlights when a recession begins and ends. 

fredr_series_search_text("recession")


add_rec_shade <- function(start_date, end_date, shade_color = "lightblue")
{
  library(ecm)
  library(fredr)
  library(ggplot2)
  
start_date <- as.Date("1947-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date(Sys.Date())
  
recession <- 
  fredr::fredr(series_ = "USRECD", 
                   observation_start = as.Date(start_date),
                   observation_end = as.Date(end_date))

recession$diff <- recession$value - lagpad(recession$value, k = 1)
  
recession <- recession[!is.na(recession$diff),]
  
recession.start <- recession[recession$diff == 1, ]$date
  
recession.end <- recession[recession$diff==(-1),]$date
  
if(length(recession.start) > length(recession.end))
{recession.end <- c(recession.end, Sys.Date())}
  
if(length(recession.end) > length(recession.start))
{recession.start <- c(min(recession$date), recession.start)}
  
recs <- as.data.frame(cbind(recession.start,
                            recession.end))
  
recs$recession.start <- as.Date(as.numeric(recs$recession.start), 
                                origin = as.Date("1970-01-01"))
  
  recs$recession.end <- as.Date(as.numeric(recs$recession.end), 
                              origin = as.Date("1970-01-01"))
  
  if(nrow(recs) > 0)
    {
    rec_shade <- geom_rect(data = recs, 
                         inherit.aes = FALSE,
                         aes(xmin = recession.start, 
                             xmax = recession.end,
                             ymin = -Inf, 
                             ymax = +Inf),
                         fill = shade_color, 
                         alpha = .5)
    return(rec_shade)
  }
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# When you want to use it just add the code "add_rec_shade" into a graphing chunk

# For example, lets add it to the graph on population

pop_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = pop_percent_change)) +
  # add the function here like this
  add_rec_shade(min(real_gdp_new$date), max(real_gdp_new$date)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Population Growth, 1952-2020", y = "Percent change from a year ago") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 100,
                                                      suffix = "%")) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman"))
```
